# EMG Signal Processing Game

Biomedical Laboratory Project:  Analysis of EMG signals of the arm to control a "Space Shooter" game 

This the project for an optional class I took (from the 3rd year of Biomedics Engineering course), which goal was to help biomedical students apply their knowledge in an end of Bachelor's project.
I completed the class with the second highest grade (17/20), without previous experience in the field.

* Isabela Miranda
* Maria Inês Bastos

## Project Description

As part of an optional subject in Biomedics Engineering, students were challenged to build a softare project with signal processing. We built a space shooter game that used Electromyography (EMG) to measure hand movement as a shooting command (instead of normal keyboard input). Singal was collected via Arduino Uno and analysed in Python and Matlab. The game interface was developed in Java..

Here is a demo of the interface (game):
